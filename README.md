# Computer Vision with Django and React

This project combines the power of computer vision with a web-based interface created using Django and React. It enables real-time image analysis, image classification, and object detection.

## Overview

- **Description**: This project leverages computer vision techniques to analyze and process images in real-time. It provides functionalities for image classification and object detection through a user-friendly web interface.
- **Technologies**: Django, React, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, RESTful APIs, Image Processing.

## Features

- **Real-time Image Analysis**: Upload images and instantly receive analysis results.
- **Image Classification**: Utilize pre-trained models for image classification tasks.
- **Object Detection**: Detect and locate objects within images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The React frontend offers an intuitive and responsive user interface.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/computer-vision-django-react.git
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install project dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Django development server.
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

4. Launch the React frontend.
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- Access the web interface at `http://localhost:3000` to start using the image analysis functionalities.
- Upload an image, select the desired task (classification or object detection), and view the results.
